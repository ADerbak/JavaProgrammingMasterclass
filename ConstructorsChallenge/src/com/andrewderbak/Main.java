		// Create a new class for bank account
		// Create fields for account number, balance, customer name, email and phone
		// number

		// Create getters and setters for each field
		// Create two additional methods
//		1. To allow the customer to deposit funds (this should increment the balance field)
//		2. To allow the customer to withdraw funds. This should deduct from the balance field,
//		but not allow the withdrawal to complete if their are insufficient funds.
//		You will want to create various code in the Main class to confirm your code is working.
//		Add some println's in the two methods above as well.
